# Responsive-Portfolio
Making responsive page with hard coding

This is an attempt to make the Week_1 Oct 26 assignment (Basic-Portfolio) 
responsive using vanilla css <br>

'fixed_header_variation_update': <br>

create an alternate layout by implementing fixed header in a separate stylesheet - style_alt.css 
minor updates to styl_media.css to address this change. <br>
the original style.css is kept intact. <br>

'flexbox&viewportunit_remove_update': <br>

this version is dedicated to remove all non-cross-browser support features introduced in css <br>
(hopefully soon we'll be able to safely use them).
